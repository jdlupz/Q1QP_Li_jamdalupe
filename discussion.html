                                The data depicted in these graphs is the distribution of universities across different regions in Luzon. Notably, 
                                the National Capital Region has the highest number
                                <br>of universities for three consecutive school years with a total of 313 universities in S.Y. 2016-2017, 315 
                                universities in S.Y. 2017-2018, and 308 universities in S.Y.
                                <br> 2018-2019. On the other hand, the Cordillera Administrative Region emerges as the region with the lowest 
                                number of universities for also three successive school years, 
                                <br>with only 42 universities in S.Y. 2016-2017, 40 universities in S.Y. 2017-2018, and 39 universities in S.Y. 
                                2018-2019. For three consecutive school years, the regions
                                <br>when arranged in ascending order according to the number of universities are in this order: Cordillera 
                                Administrative Region, MIMAROPA, Cagayan Valley, Ilocos 
                                <br>Region, Bicol Region, Central Luzon, CALABARZON, National Capital Region.
                            </p>

                            
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <p>
                                    Noting the fact that there may be underlying causes for the consistent ranking of these regions in terms of 
                                    their number of high education institutions for three consecutive years, we listed possible factors why there 
                                    are more universities in the National Capital Region compared to the Cordillera Administrative Region. These 
                                    are:
                                    Population: 
                                        To accommodate students, more educational institutions or universities are needed in NCR, which has a 
                                        larger population than CAR (Luzon , n.d.).
                                    Government Funding (only applied to universities under the government): 
                                        The number of universities may vary depending on the government funds allotted to a region or possibly 
                                        based on location. Given its location, it's most likely that the NCR receives more funding than the CAR.
                                    Legacy: 
                                        Manila was the center of education during the Spanish colonial era, which is why there may be more 
                                        universities in the NCR as a result of its established reputation (QS International, 2023).
                                    Infrastructure and Transportation: 
                                        The NCR has better-developed infrastructure and transportation than the CAR, making universities more 
                                        accessible to students.
                                    Resources: 
                                        The NCR has several research institutes, making it more convenient for students attending universities 
                                        there.

                                The graphical representation of university distribution in Luzon is notable with the majority being private. Out 
                                of the total number of universities surveyed, 95% of them belong to the private sector. On the other hand, the 
                                public sector, represented by SUCs, accounts for a mere 5% of the total, consisting of only 57 universities for 
                                three consecutive years.

                            <p>
                                Based on the current situation of our government, from these parameters, we can infer that the possible cause of 
                                the dominance of private colleges in Luzon is the difference in the source of funding. Private schools, as 
                                privately owned institutions, operate independently of government funding. In contrast, public schools rely on 
                                budget allocations provided by the government, leading to limited resources (Public Vs Private Colleges: What’s 
                                the Difference? - Crimson Education US, n.d.).

                                As shown in the three histograms for the number of students in three school years, the shape of the distributions 
                                is extremely skewed to the right or positively skewed. All three are single-peaked and have wide gaps and outliers.

                            <br>

                            <p>
                                We can interpret from the histogram that in the S.Y. 2016-2017, the majority of all the universities in Luzon 
                                have a student population within the range 1-2001. While the two next school years have schools with student 
                                bodies within range 1-1740 and 2-1764, respectively. While most student populations lie within the mentioned 
                                ranges in specific school years, there are still some considerable outliers in the data. For example, the sole 
                                college who had a student population within the range of 64033 to 66033 in S.Y. 2016-2017 is an extreme outlier.

                                and 1624.73, respectively. The standard deviation of the number of students in S.Y. 2016-2017, S.Y. 2017-2018, 
                                and S.Y. 2018-2019 are 5051.28, 4915.54, and 4529.13, respectively. However, since the distribution of the number 
                                of students in all three school years are extremely positively skewed, the appropriate measure of center and 
                                variability to be used are the median, interquartile range (IQR), and the five-number summary (Min, Q1, Md, Q3, Max).

                            <br>

                            <p>
                                The medians of the number of students in S.Y. 2016-2017, S.Y. 2017-2018, and S.Y. 2018-2019 are 406.5, 359.5, and 
                                357.5, respectively. We can interpret from this that the average number of students that attend a college school 
                                in Luzon has been 407 in the S.Y. 2016-2017, 360 students in S.Y. 2017-2018, and 358 students in S.Y. 2018-2019. 
                                Noticeably, the number of students has been decreasing year by year from these parameters. More graduates or 
                                drop-outs than enrollees can be a plausible explanation for this decline. On a general scale, this decline of 
                                student populations may imply poor administration of some colleges, ineffective leadership, and personnel issues, 
                                all of which are detrimental environments to a budding student.

                            <p>
                                The IQRs in the three school years (1120.75, 1000, and 941, respectively) are considerably low, which suggests 
                                there is a consistent small difference between the schools in the upper portion and the lower portion of the 
                                clustered data set for successive years. Moreover, from the values of the skewness of the three descriptive 
                                summaries, it can be inferred that the S.Y. 2018-2019 had a number of students that is more skewed than the 
                                previous two school years.
                            </p>

                                Lastly, in the S.Y. 2016-2017, all college schools had at least 1 number of students and at most 66011, if 
                                outliers are included. In this school year, 50 percent of all the colleges in Luzon had a student population 
                                within the range of 130 to 1251 students. Furthermore, if outliers are considered, in S.Y. 2017 to 2018, all 
                                colleges had at least 1 student and up to 57403 overall. 50 percent of all the colleges in Luzon had a student 
                                body between 133 and 1133 during this academic year. As of the S.Y. 2018-2019, all colleges in Luzon had at least 
                                2 students and, if outliers are taken into account, a maximum of 58167 students. During this academic year, 50% of 
                                all the colleges in Luzon had 111 to 1052 students enrolled.

                                universities in Luzon have a faculty population within the range 1-115. While most faculty populations lie within 
                                the ranges in specific school years, there are still some considerable outliers in the data.

                                The mean of the number of faculty in S.Y. 2016-2017, S.Y. 2017-2018, and S.Y. 2018-2019 are 78.34, 74.95, and 
                                74.39, respectively. The standard deviation of the number of faculty in S.Y. 2016-2017, S.Y. 2017-2018, and S.Y. 
                                2018-2019 are 193.66, 191.20, and 192.45, respectively. However, since the distribution of the number of faculty 
                                in all three school years are extremely positively skewed, the appropriate measure of center and variability to be

                                respectively. Furthermore, the IQRs in the three school years (42, 39, and 37, respectively) are considerably low 
                                in relative to the values in the data set, which suggests there is a small difference between the faculty 
                                population in the schools in the upper portion and the lower portion of the clustered data set. Based on the 
                                descriptive summaries, it can be noted that the S.Y. of 2017-2018 had the most skewed distribution among the three 
                                data sets.

                                In this school year, 50 percent of all the colleges in Luzon had a faculty population within the range of 16 to 58 
                                people. Furthermore, if outliers are considered, all colleges had at least 1 staff and up to 3760 staff overall 
                                in S.Y. 2017 to 2018. 50 percent of all the colleges in Luzon had a number of faculties between 16 to 55 during 
                                this academic year. As of the S.Y. 2018-2019, all colleges in Luzon had at least 1 faculty and, if outliers are 
                                taken into account, a maximum of 3690. During this academic year, 16 to 53 faculties were employed at 50% of all 
                                the colleges in Luzon.

                                Noticeably, the parameters of the number of faculty also declined, like the number of students, when we examine 
                                the median and percentiles. The decrease in the average personnel per college in Luzon can imply employment issues. 
                                It may be possible that there were more employees retiring or resigning from their jobs than newcomers. The 
                                inflation in goods and the implemented increase of the minimum wage can also be factors for establishments to fire 
                                their people and lessen their staff.

                                The mean of the faculty-student ratio in S.Y. 2016-2017, S.Y. 2017-2018, and S.Y. 2018-2019 are 0.126, 0.128, and 
                                0.143, respectively. The standard deviation of the faculty-student ratio in S.Y. 2016-2017, S.Y. 2017-2018, and 
                                S.Y. 2018-2019 are 0.169, 0.158, and 0.189, respectively. However, since the distribution of the faculty-student 
                                ratio in all three school years are positively skewed, the appropriate measure of center and variability to be used 
                                are the median, interquartile range (IQR), and the five-number summary (Min, Q1, Md, Q3, Max).

                                The IQRs in the three school years (0.101, 0.095, and 0.122, respectively) are considerably low in relative to the 
                                values in the data set, which suggests there is a small difference between the faculty population in the schools 
                                in the upper portion and the lower portion of the clustered data set. Based on the descriptive summaries, it can 
                                be noted that the S.Y. of 2017-2018 had the most skewed distribution among the three data sets.

                                In the S.Y. 2016-2017, all colleges had a minimum ratio of 0.002 and a maximum ratio of 1, if outliers are 
                                considered. In this school year, 50 percent of all the colleges in Luzon had a ratio within the range of 0.042 to 
                                0.143 . Furthermore, if outliers are considered, all colleges had a minimum ratio of 0.001 and a maximum ratio of 
                                1 in S.Y. 2017 to 2018. 50 percent of all the colleges in Luzon had a ratio between 0.048 to 0.143 during this 
                                academic year. As of the S.Y. 2018-2019, all colleges in Luzon had a minimum ratio of 0.001 and, if outliers are 
                                taken into account, a maximum ratio of 1. During this academic year, a ratio of 0.045 to 0.167 are observed at 50% 
                                of all the colleges in Luzon.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <p>
                                Considering that the ideal faculty-student ratio is 1:25 (0.04 in decimal form), according to a DepEd Executive 
                                Order (No. 349), these parameters roughly indicate an improving faculty-to-student ratio in relation to the 
                                standard one. The higher the faculty-student ratio of a college is to 0.04, the more satisfactory it is, as it 
                                means that there is a faculty-student ratio of less than 1:25. The lesser the faculty-student ratio of a college 
                                is to 0.04, the more unsatisfactory it is, as it means that there is a faculty-student ratio of more than 1:25. 
                                This means that 1 faculty staff may have handled at least 26 students at a time, which is not ideal. 
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                If we closely examine the histogram, the range that unquestionably represents a poor ratio is the range from 0 to 
                                0.032. The schools that belong to this range have faculty-to-student ratios lower than 0.04, which imply poor 
                                learning experience to students since with such ratio, students have less opportunities to interact with their 
                                teachers. Furthermore, they may suggest less attention to the development of students, causing hindrances to 
                                education. Throughout the school years, we can observe from the histograms that the number of colleges that belong 
                                on that range had significantly decreased from S.Y. 2016-2017 to S.Y. 2017-2018, from 159 to 110, even though it 
                                slightly increased in S.Y. 2018-2019, having 112 colleges. Nevertheless, it did not rise to an alarming rate. Even 
                                though a high number of about 100 schools still belong to that range and therefore exhibit a poor ratio, the 
                                decrease still signifies good progress in higher education in Luzon.

                                To further analyze our data set, the median shall be used to encapsulate the whole population of Luzon state and 
                                private colleges, and through determining whether the median of the ratios increase or decrease in relation to 
                                0.04—which is the standard—we can conclude whether the faculty-student ratio of the state and private colleges of 
                                Luzon gets better or worse every year. In the three school years, the medians are 0.067, 0.077, and 0.071, 
                                respectively. Within these three school years, it can be concluded that more than half of the colleges in Luzon 
                                had a satisfactory faculty-student ratio as the medians of the three school years are 0.027, 0.037, and 0.031 
                                above the standard ratio of 0.04, respectively.

                            <p>
                                Furthermore, to see a thorough and clear display whether there really is an association between the changes of 
                                the number of students and faculty to the changes in the faculty-to-student ratio during the three school years, 
                                let's study the decrease rates of the students and faculty based on their medians. From S.Y. 2016-2017 to S.Y. 
                                2017-2018, the decrease rate of the students was 13.1% while the decrease rate of the faculty was only 3.5%. This 
                                means that the student population in Luzon decreased faster than the faculty. This calculation is aligned with the 
                                increase of the ratio from 0.67 of S.Y. 2016-2017 to 0.77 of S.Y. 2017-2018, indicating that more colleges had 
                                better ratios in the second year.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                However, the median of the ratios decreased in the following year, from S.Y. 2017-2018’s 0.77 to 0.71 of S.Y. 
                                2018-2019. This may indicate that there were a few colleges who had a faculty-student ratio which did not improve 
                                or became unfavorable. This decrease was evident in our data set since students only had a decrease rate of 0.55% 
                                compared to the 3.8% decrease of the faculty in S.Y. 2017-2018 to S.Y. 2018-2019. At that time, Luzon was losing 
                                more school personnel than students. So, it was reasonable for the faculty-to-student ratio to deteriorate or 
                                worsen. Nonetheless, the general population of the state and private colleges of Luzon had a relatively 
                                satisfactory ratio within the three school years.

                        Compared to other parts of Luzon, the National Capital Region has the highest education institutions, likely as a result 
                        of its substantial population, advanced infrastructure, and extensive intellectual resources. The Cordillera Administrative 
                        Region, on the other side, has the fewest colleges. Furthermore, private universities make up over 95% of all higher 
                        education institutions in Luzon. In general, higher education in Luzon is in good standing and is progressing positively 
                        in terms of the faculty-to-student ratio. The majority of all the schools in Luzon by S.Y. 2018-2019 already have a 
                        satisfactory faculty-to-student ratio, which often indicates more individual attention on each student, further promoting 
                        their growth and development. However, colleges in Luzon have faced a decline in the aspects of student and faculty body 
                        for the past three school years. These declines really show poor development because naturally we should expect more 
                        students at schools due to our increasing population. Furthermore, if we want to cope with our ideal growing student 
                        population, then more people should be given job opportunities and be employed to cater to the rising demands of students.

                        Considering that CHED (Commission on Higher Education) collects their data through their “Annual Higher Education 
                        Data/Information Collection” survey, some schools were unable to give their complete data regarding their student and 
                        faculty population. For instance, in the S.Y. 2017-2018, out of 1098 of S.Y. 2017-2018 colleges, only 624 colleges were 
                        able to provide a complete data of their student population. Moreover, only 1076 colleges were able to provide complete 
                        data of their faculty population, and only 1046 colleges were able to provide complete data of their faculty/student ratio. 
                        Although the effect of these nonresponse biases to our data sets are mild to none, we cannot counter the fact that these 
                        missing links may serve to benefit the parameters we are examining.

                        As long as our nation continue to develop and advance its assets, our education system, especially in higher levels, 
                        should always be given great consideration and attention for our schools are the place where our students learn how to 
                        further develop their skills, become individuals they aspire to be, and become citizens of our country who selflessly 
                        devote one’s capabilities in service to our nation. Constant and consistent monitoring of the current state and condition 
                        of our country’s current metropolitan center, which is Luzon, can greatly aid our government in making informed decisions 
                        that would hopefully improve our education system. With these parameters, it can also serve as a basis or prompts for 
                        future research—finding out more plausible causes for the decrease of the number of students and faculty within these 
                        three school years. Furthermore, there are many factors other than location and class size to consider when we examine 
                        higher education. Influences such as economic, cultural, and social factors and teaching methods are highly encouraged to 
                        be studied in future research.
